My name is Antonio God√≠nez, I'm studying a Computer System Engineering, soon I will finish.

During my career, I learnt about programming in Java, C# and Python, also to make web systems with HTML and PHP. I'm a little bit better on management and desgin of databases and computer networks.

I love to listen to music when I'm doing an important activity or task, because I got more focused. Also I work better under pressure.

If i don't kwon something, I try to research about it. Because i don't like to feel without context or stucked in the same thing without improving on me

And.., Idk what more write.

See'ya
